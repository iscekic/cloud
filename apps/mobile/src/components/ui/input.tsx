/**
 * The shared single-line box: `min-h-[44px] px-3 leading-[normal]`.
 *
 * This is the only place the single-line box lives. A call site keeps its own
 * chrome (border, fill, text size) and its own horizontal padding — a caller's
 * `px-4` overrides the shared `px-3` through tailwind-merge, because the
 * caller's className comes after the box's shape in `cn` — but it must not add
 * vertical padding or a fixed height: the box already brings `min-h-[44px]`
 * (the touch floor, and a floor rather than a height so Dynamic Type still
 * grows the field) and `leading-[normal]` (one line box for the placeholder
 * and the value, which the same TextInput draws).
 *
 * The request's "explicit vertical padding" is delivered as this explicit
 * vertical box instead: `apps/mobile/AGENTS.md` (Text inputs) forbids `py-*`
 * on a single-line input, because iOS insets the already-centered text rect by
 * the padding and draws the text and the placeholder low. Vertical padding
 * would move both below the middle, which the "focused and unfocused put the
 * text in the same place" requirement and the 44pt floor cannot accept.
 * `textAlignVertical: 'center'` is the Android half of the same fix: the
 * platform's default gravity is top in a taller box while the placeholder is
 * drawn by a different path, which is the baseline split the sign-in email
 * field showed.
 *
 * `withRtlInputAlignment` stays on every single-line input: RN 0.86 does not
 * resolve `textAlign: 'auto'` from the native direction, so a Latin address
 * stays left-aligned under a right-aligned label in an RTL catalog
 * (`rtl-text.ts`).
 *
 * An explicit caller alignment survives that default whichever channel carries
 * it. A caller's own `style` already wins, because `withRtlInputAlignment`
 * prepends `{ textAlign: 'right' }` ahead of it. A caller's `textAlign` *prop*
 * does not: React Native resolves a flattened `style` after the prop, so the
 * injected right alignment would override a `textAlign="center"` prop in RTL
 * (the Security Agent SLA day fields, which are centred in every locale).
 * `Input` folds the prop into the style behind the caller's own style, so the
 * caller's choice stays last and wins on both platforms and in both
 * directions.
 *
 * A `multiline` caller is a different control: it keeps its own box (an
 * explicit `leading-*`) and its own `textAlignVertical`, and keeps its own
 * `numberOfLines` (no default is applied), so neither the shared box nor the
 * forced vertical alignment applies. A single-line caller is pinned to
 * `numberOfLines={1}`, so the placeholder and the value cannot wrap to a second
 * line and shift the text off the box's vertical centre.
