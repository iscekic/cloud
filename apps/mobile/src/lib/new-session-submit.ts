/**
 * Pure boolean predicate for whether the "Start session" button on the
 * new-agent screen may submit right now. Lives in `lib/` (not next to
 * the route) so the regression test for the Wave 2 C3a slice can pin
 * both halves of the contract without rendering anything:
 *
 *   1. The existing cloud-agent path is byte-identical to before this
 *      slice landed — `canCreate` is computed with the exact same
 *      expression, and `isCloudAgentTargetSelected` defaults to `true`
 *      because the route's `runOnInstance` state defaults to `null`.
 *   2. Whenever a remote target is selected, the predicate evaluates
 *      to `false` REGARDLESS of the rest of the input. The actual
 *      remote submit wiring is a later slice (C3b); until then the
 *      start button must stay inert so we cannot accidentally fire
 *      the cloud-agent path with the wrong target.
