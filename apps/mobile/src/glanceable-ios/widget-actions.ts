 *
 * 1. Live — subscribe to `onExpoWidgetsUserInteraction` at app start. The
 *    intent has already merged the press marker (`pendingAction`) into the
 *    pressed entry's props before the notification arrives, so the marker
 *    itself maps the event's `source`/`target` to the action to run.
 * 2. Sweep — on app launch and on every foreground of the agents tab, read the
 *    stored timeline and run any entry whose props carry the marker. This
 *    covers a cold start, where the intent patched the marker long before JS
 *    subscribed.
 *
 * Both paths funnel through one sweep that clears the marker from the timeline
 * before invoking the action, so a crash mid-action — or the foreground sweep
 * racing a live listener — can never run the same press twice.
