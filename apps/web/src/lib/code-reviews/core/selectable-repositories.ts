/**
 * Repository-list builders shared by the code review settings UI and the REVIEW.md conversion route.
 *
 * Two callers with DIFFERENT inputs, on purpose:
 * - The general settings repo list (`ReviewConfigForm.selectableRepositories`) passes the fetched
 *   integration repos PLUS manually-added legacy entries.
 * - The conversion dialog and the server route's allowlist pass the fetched integration repos ONLY
 *   (manually-added entries are unverified client input and must not authorize a billable action).
 *
 * The sync guarantee is scoped to the CONVERSION path: the dialog and the route both build from the
 * fetched list only, via these helpers, so a repo the dialog offers is always one the route allows.
 * If manually-added entries are ever added back to the server-side allowlist, add them to the
 * conversion dialog's list too (or drop this guarantee), or the two will diverge.
