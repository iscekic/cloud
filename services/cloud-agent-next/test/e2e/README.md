# cloud-agent-next local E2E harness

Drives the real `pnpm dev:start cloud-agent` stack end-to-end — Worker,
Durable Object, Sandbox container, wrapper, and **real kilo** inside the
sandbox. Only LLM inference is deterministic: selecting
`kilo/fake-deterministic` makes the local Next.js gateway proxy kilo's
OpenRouter-shaped calls to `test/e2e/fake-llm-server.ts`.

Not wired into `pnpm test` / CI — this is for local confidence during the
cloud-agent-next refactor.

## One-time setup

1. Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars` and fill in local values.
   Leave `KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE` pointed at local Next.js (`@url nextjs/api`).
2. Ensure local Postgres is up and root `.env.local` defines `POSTGRES_URL`
   (or export `DATABASE_URL`) — the driver inserts a test user row via
   `@kilocode/db`.
3. Start the stack. The `cloud-agent` group already includes `fake-llm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev:start cloud-agent
   ```

   Selecting `kilo/fake-deterministic` is enough to hit fake-llm through
   Next.js. A real-model session (`kilo-auto/efficient`, etc.) uses the same
   Worker URL and does not need a restart.

## Credential containment

`CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED` controls GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Kilo
credential containment together for new non-devcontainer sessions. Containment
is enabled unless this variable is set to `false`.

Local `dev` defaults to `false` because of Cloudflare's local outbound proxy
limitations. Set `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED=true` in `.dev.vars` to opt in
when using proxy-compatible upstreams. Devcontainer sessions remain excluded
because DIND does not support managed SCM containment.

Containment flags are persisted on the workspace at session creation, so
changing this variable requires a new session; existing sessions keep their
original containment flags.

## Running

> **Non-zero port offset:** the commands below use the default ports
> (`8794`/`8811`), which only match a zero-offset session. For any other
> session, first read the offset from `pnpm dev:status --json`
> (`portOffset` field), then prefix every driver invocation with
> `WORKER_URL=http://localhost:<8794 + portOffset>` and
> `FAKE_LLM_URL=http://localhost:<8811 + portOffset>`. Without these the
> driver silently hits the wrong Worker/fake-LLM and every scenario fails
> at connection. See the env-var table below for the full list.

Official SDK basic-chat acceptance (pinned `@kilocode/sdk/v2` `7.4.20`):

```bash
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/sdk-basic-chat.ts
```

This uses a funded ephemeral local user and sends only `Authorization: Bearer ...`
to `/kilo`; prompt mutations therefore pass through real public balance
validation rather than the legacy lifecycle driver's tRPC bypass header. Because
`client.session.create()` is deliberately unsupported by the basic facade, the
driver first materializes one owned root through the existing lifecycle setup,
then proves SDK attach/chat behavior: warm and cold projected reads, cold event
wake-up plus `promptAsync()`, intentional `prompt()` rejection, active `abort()`,
stable warm/cold message pagination, and selector rejection without transcript mutation.
It stops owned sandbox families and releases any fake-LLM gate in cleanup.

Focused lifecycle scenario:

```bash
tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/run.ts [--api=unified|legacy] <lifecycle> <conversation>
```

Matrix (runs the default regression suite):

```bash
tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/smoke.ts
```

The matrix starts with `cold-hot`, which pays one cold sandbox boot and then
runs several hot same-session turns. Fresh sessions use per-session sandboxes
in local dev, so the harness identifies each newly-created sandbox instead of
killing every sandbox between cases. Kill scenarios only terminate the sandbox
family created for that scenario.

Per-run overrides via env vars. Defaults assume a zero-offset session;
for any other offset, compute the real ports from `pnpm dev:status --json`
(worker = `8794 + portOffset`, fake-LLM = `8811 + portOffset`):

| Var | Default |
|---|---|
| `WORKER_URL` | `http://localhost:8794` |
| `FAKE_LLM_URL` | `http://localhost:8811` (host-side view) |
| `E2E_GIT_URL` | `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git` |
| `E2E_MODEL` | `kilo/fake-deterministic` (the only model the fake serves) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional direct database URL override for this harness |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | Repo database fallback loaded from root `.env.local` / `.env` |

If `DATABASE_URL` is unset, the standalone TSX driver loads root `.env.local`
and `.env`, then falls back to `@kilocode/db` `computeDatabaseUrl()`, which
uses `POSTGRES_URL` for local development.

`FAKE_LLM_URL` is how the **driver** reaches the fake server (for
`/test/release`, `/test/gate-status`, `/test/waiters`, and `/test/requests`
side channels). `KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE` stays on Next.js; the gateway routes
`fake-deterministic` to fake-llm. If you changed the fake's port (e.g.
non-zero `portOffset`), set `FAKE_LLM_URL` to the matching host-reachable
view. Next.js picks up the same offset from `apps/web/.env.development.local`.

## Gateway contract

The fake gateway serves the Kilo routes used in this harness:

- `GET /api/openrouter/models` - runtime model discovery inside sandboxed kilo.
- `POST /api/openrouter/models/validate` - Worker-side fail-fast model validation.
- `POST /api/openrouter/chat/completions` - deterministic streamed completion scenarios.

### SDK coverage boundary

`sdk-basic-chat.ts` intentionally avoids timing-sensitive assertions already
covered by focused unit or Workers-runtime fixtures: multi-root mapping
ordering and zero-DO list projection, R2 replacement races, private-path
optional fixture variants, and SSE heartbeat/comment parsing. The normal acceptance
scenario asserts that blocking `prompt()` remains intentionally unsupported;
chat admission and wake-up are tested exclusively through `promptAsync()`.

## Conversation directives

A conversation directive is embedded in the user-visible prompt as
`__fake__:<scenario>[:<arg1>[:<arg2>...]]`. The fake LLM gateway parses it
from the last user message and dispatches the matching scenario. The
source of directive truth is `test/e2e/fake-llm-server.ts`.

| Directive | Behavior |
|---|---|
| *(no `__fake__:` directive)* | Echo the last user message after stripping kilo `<environment_details>`. |
| `slow:<n>:<ms>` | `n` content chunks `<ms>` apart, then stop + `[DONE]`. Used for pacing/timing probes. |
| `idle` | One empty-delta chunk, then stop + `[DONE]`. |
| `hang` | Opens the SSE stream but emits nothing and never closes. Drives abort/timeout paths. |
| `error:<msg>` | HTTP 402 with OpenAI-shaped error body carrying `<msg>`. Exercises kilo's error propagation. |
| `gate:<tag>` | Opens the SSE stream, emits no chunks, blocks until the driver calls `POST /test/release?tag=<tag>`. On release, emits `"done"` + stop + `[DONE]`. |

Unknown `__fake__:<name>` directives produce HTTP 402 with
`unknown fake scenario: <name>` — easy to spot in fake-LLM logs.
A prompt with no `__fake__:` prefix echoes instead.

### Side channels

The fake LLM server exposes four helper endpoints for driver code (not used
by kilo):

- `POST /test/release?tag=<tag>` — release a parked `gate:<tag>` turn. 204
  on hit, 404 if no waiter is parked for that tag.
- `GET /test/gate-status?tag=<tag>` — returns `{ tag, engaged }` so the
  driver can poll until a gate is actually holding a stream (i.e. kilo has
  dialed the fake and the turn is blocked).
- `GET /test/waiters` — returns parked gate counts plus live hang/gate streams
  so scenarios can detect leaked fake-server waiters after a terminal turn.
- `GET /test/requests` — returns chat completion request counts so model
  preflight scenarios can prove that rejected models did not reach dispatch.

These are wrapped by `releaseGate()`, `waitForGateEngaged()`,
`fetchFakeWaiters()`, and `fetchFakeRequests()` in `client.ts`.

## Lifecycle scenarios

| Lifecycle | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cold` | Fresh session; verify a new per-session sandbox appears and the conversation completes. |
| `hot` | Warmup with `echo:warmup`, then send the real prompt on the same session. Same container. |
| `followup` | Same as `hot` today; kept distinct for future resume-path splits. |
| `cold-hot` | One cold turn plus `echo:hot`, `slow:3:50`, and `echo:followup` hot turns on the same session/sandbox. |
| `external-kill` | Warmup, `docker kill` the sandbox, send another prompt, verify recovery/failure. |
| `kill-mid-flight` | Cold `hang`, kill while pending, verify DO surfaces disconnect/error. |
| `queue-while-busy` | Block on `gate:<tag>`, enqueue two echoes, release the gate, assert FIFO delivery through `cloud.message.*` events. |
| `queue-rapid-fire-no-gate` | Send immediate follow-ups behind `echo:first` and assert they reach their terminal FIFO state without gate coordination. |
| `queue-overflow` | Block on `gate:overflow`, fill the pending queue until enqueue fails with HTTP 429, release gate, drain. |
| `queue-interrupt-clears` | Block on `gate:<tag>`, enqueue two, `interruptSession`, assert `cloud.message.failed` with `reason: 'interrupted'` for each. |
| `llm-error` | Return fake provider HTTP 402 and assert the turn reaches a failed terminal event instead of hanging. |
| `chunked-streaming` | Stream delayed fake chunks and assert multiple downstream `message.part.delta` events survive. |
| `empty-response` | Run `idle`, assert completion, and assert no downstream `message.part.delta` is emitted. |
| `interrupt-mid-stream` | Interrupt an actively gated fake request and assert the active message is interrupted, not a queued message. |
| `unknown-model` | Use a model rejected by the fake validation route and require synchronous rejection before sandbox creation or fake chat dispatch. |
| `waiters-clean` | Complete a normal fake turn, then assert the fake server has no parked waiters or live responses. |
| `callback-completion` | Stand up local HTTP sink, register `callbackTarget.url`, run `echo:done`, assert the sink received `status: 'completed'`. |
| `callback-batch-followup` | Queue two turns behind a gated callback session, assert one callback for the final queued turn, then assert a later hot turn emits a fresh callback. |
| `callback-interrupt` | Local HTTP sink + gated active turn + `interruptSession`, assert callback fires with `status: 'interrupted'`. |

### API dimension

The harness exercises both tRPC surfaces. Pass `--api=legacy` to drive the
`prepareSession` + `initiateFromKilocodeSessionV2` + `sendMessageV2`
procedures (what the web UI uses today); the default `--api=unified` uses
the newer `start` / `send` procedures. `prepareSession` requires
`INTERNAL_API_SECRET` — the driver reads it from `.dev.vars` automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Must provide either githubRepo or gitUrl`** — The driver defaults to
  a public HTTPS repo. Override with `E2E_GIT_URL=...` if your network
  blocks GitHub or you prefer a different test repo.
- **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` not set** — Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars`
  and fill in the local secret (same value used by `apps/web`).
- **`POSTGRES_URL not configured`** — Set root `.env.local` `POSTGRES_URL`,
  or export `DATABASE_URL` to override the database URL for this harness.
- **Sandbox calls out to a real provider** — the session model must be
  `kilo/fake-deterministic`, Next.js must have `FAKE_LLM_URL` set (from
  `pnpm dev:env`), and the `fake-llm` service must be running
  (`pnpm dev:status`). Tail the fake's log (`tail -f dev/logs/fake-llm.log`)
  to confirm kilo is hitting it through the gateway.
- **`waitForGateEngaged` timed out** — kilo never reached the fake LLM. Most
  common cause: the session used a real model, `FAKE_LLM_URL` is missing from
  Next.js, or the fake service is not running. Confirm with
  `curl -s $FAKE_LLM_URL/test/requests` (expect a rising `chatCompletions`
  count as kilo dials the fake) and `tail -f dev/logs/fake-llm.log` — a
  stream that stays empty while a turn is "preparing" means the wrapper
  never started, not a fake-LLM problem.
- **`Worker "git-token-service-dev" not found` in `cloud-agent-next.log`** —
  the `GIT_TOKEN_SERVICE` service binding could not resolve. The Worker log
  shows the failure as `Failed to issue Kilo session capability` and the turn
  terminates immediately with `cloud.message.failed`. Cause: the
  `cloudflare-git-token-service` dev process is up on its port but stale and
  not heartbeating into the shared dev-registry (check
  `.wrangler/dev-registry/` for a missing `git-token-service-dev` entry). Fix:
  `pnpm dev:restart cloudflare-git-token-service`, then confirm the entry
  reappears. The fake LLM is irrelevant here — kilo never gets far enough to
  dial it.
- **Matrix fails intermittently with `preparing×N` and no terminal** —
  environmental, not a regression. The `@cloudflare/containers` library's
  container control connection sometimes returns 503 under Docker Desktop
  load, triggering exponential-backoff retries that consume the scenario
  timeout. The `smoke.ts` matrix now kills stale containers before starting
  and uses a 120s per-scenario timeout, but this is not always enough. If
  the matrix is flaky: (1) stop any competing dev session from another
  worktree that also runs Cloud Agent sandboxes; (2) prune stopped containers
  (`docker ps -a --filter status=exited --format '{{.Names}}' | rg
  workerd-cloud-agent | xargs -r docker rm -f`); (3) restart
  `cloud-agent-next` to clear stale DO alarm timers; (4) re-run the failing
  scenario standalone — if it passes alone, the matrix failure was Docker
  contention, not code.
- **`releaseGate` returned 404** — the gate already went away, usually
  because the wrapper's request was aborted (e.g. by an `interruptSession`).
  Queue-interrupt-clears tolerates this; other scenarios treat it as an
  error.
